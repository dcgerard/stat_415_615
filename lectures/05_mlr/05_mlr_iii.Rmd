# Quadratic Terms

- Consider the Muscle Mass data which explores the association between age and muscle mass. You can read about it [here](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data.html#Muscle_Mass).

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(broom)
    muscle <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/muscle.csv")
    glimpse(muscle)
    ```

- These data look like a quadratic fit could help
    ```{r}
    qplot(x = age, y = mass, data = muscle) +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    
    lm_musc <- lm(mass ~ age, data = muscle)
    a_musc <- augment(lm_musc)
    qplot(x = .fitted, y = .resid, data = a_musc) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 2)
    ```
    
- A quadratice regression model with one predictor variable is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_{2}X_{i}^2 + \epsilon_i
    $$
    with the usual assumptions on the errors.

- We fit this in R by first creating a new variable, say `age2`, with contains `age` squared.
    ```{r}
    muscle <- mutate(muscle, age2 = age^2)
    glimpse(muscle)
    ```

- We then fit a multiple linear regression model using `age` and `age2` as predictors.

    ```{r}
    lm_musc2 <- lm(mass ~ age + age2, data = muscle)
    tidy(lm_musc2)
    ```

- The estimated regression surface is
    $$
    \hat{Y} = 207.360 - 2.964X + 0.015X^2
    $$
    
- The $p$-value corresponding to `age2` is a test for the quadratic term (linear regression as the null versus quadratic regression as the alternative). The $p$-value in this case (0.08) says that we only have week evidence of a quadratic relationship.

- **Exercise**: Write out the null and alternative models associated with the $p$-value of 0.08109.

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    - $H_0: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$
    - $H_A: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    ```


- **Exercise**: What are the null and alternative models associated with the $p$-value of 0.004535?

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    - $H_0: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    - $H_A: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    ```

- It's possible to fit higher order polynomials. E.g. a cubic polynomial
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_{2}X_{i}^2 + \beta_3 X_{i}^3 + \epsilon_i
    $$
    We would do this via
    
    ```{r}
    muscle <- mutate(muscle, age3 = age^3)
    lm_m3 <- lm(mass ~ age + age2 + age3, data = muscle)
    tidy(lm_m3)
    ```
    However, it is rarely a good idea to fit terms higher than quadratic. This is because
    
    1. They tend to be sensative to overfitting and
    2. They are hard to interpret.
    
    So at that point, you should just fit a cubic spline to these data, since it will be equally uninterpretable.
    
- If you include a quadratic term you should **always** include the linear term as well.

- That is, you should **never** fit the model
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    $$
    even if the $p$-value is very high.
    
- Why? This follows the same logic as always including the intercept term in the model. Lower order terms are thought to provide more basic information on the relationship, so you should include them.

- More generally, if you do end up using a cubic term, you should always include both linear and quadratic terms in the model, etc...


- When there are multiple predictors in the model, it is usual to denote quadratic coefficients with repeat indices. E.g.
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{2}X_{i2} + \beta_{22}X_{i2}^2 + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- **Exericse**: Write out a model that contains two predictors, $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$, where only $X_{i2}$ is quadratic (and so the model is linear in $X_{i2}$). Use the repeated indexing that we just introduced.

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{2}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    ```

# Categorical Variables

- An innovation in the insurance industry was introduced, and a researcher wanted to study what factors affect how quickly different insurance firms adopted this new innovation. Variables include
    - `months`: How long, in months, it took the firm to adopt the new innovation.
    - `size`: The amount of total assets of the insurance firm, in millions of dollars.
    - `type`: The type of firm. Either a mutual company (`"mutual"`) or a stock company (`"stock"`).
    
    You can load these data into R via:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    firm <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/firm.csv")
    glimpse(firm)
    ```

- Recall that we deal with categorical variables by creating indicators
    $$
    X_{i2} =
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if stock company}\\
    0 & \text{ otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

- If a categorical variable has $c$ classes, then we need to use $c-1$ indicator variables to represent this categorical variable. 

- Here, $c = 2$ (for `"stock"` and `"mutual"`), so we only need $c-1=1$ indicator variable.

- Let $Y_i$ be the number of months elapsed for company $i$, and $X_{i1}$ be the size of the firm in millions of dollars. Then we will fit the following model.

    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- The interpretation of $\beta_1$ is as usual. Firms that are the same type, but are 10 million dollars larger, tended to take $10 \times \beta_1$ months less to innovate.
    
- To interpret $\beta_2$, consider that the model for mutual companies is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    while the model for stock companies is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the same in both instances.
    
- This means that $\beta_2$ is the expected difference in months between mutual and stock companies that are about the same size.

- Let's visualize this model
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    
    firm %>%
      rename(Type = type) %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = size, y = months, color = Type)) +
      geom_point() +
      theme_classic() +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.102, intercept = 33.874, color = "#005AB5", lwd = 1.5) +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.102, intercept = 41.93, color = "#DC3220", lwd = 1.5) +
      xlab("Size of Firm (millions of dollars)") +
      ylab("Number of Months Elapsed") +
      scale_color_manual(values = c("#005AB5", "#DC3220")) ->
      pl
      ## ggsave(filename = "./figs/cat_interp.pdf", plot = pl, height = 4, width = 5.5)
    ```
    
    ```{r,echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/cat_interp.png")
    ```

- In R, you fit this model by first converting the categorical variable into a **factor** with `factor()`. You specify the order of the levels by the `levels` argument, where the first level is the **reference level** (the one that does not have an indicator for it).
    ```{r}
    firm <- mutate(firm, type = factor(type, levels = c("mutual", "stock")))
    ```
    Then you can use the new factor variable in `lm()`. It will automatically create $c-1$ indicator variables to fit.
    ```{r}
    lm_firm <- lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    tidy(lm_firm, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```
    We conclude that stock companies tended to take 8 months longer than mutual companies to adopt the new innovation (95\% CI of 5 to 11 months longer), adjusting for company size. Companies of the same type that had \$10 million more assets tended to take 1 fewer month to adopt the new innovation (95\% CI of 0.8 to 1.2 fewer months).
    
- If you wanted to change which level is the reference level of a factor variable, you could use `fct_relevel()` from the `{forcats}` package (apart of the tidyverse).
    ```{r}
    firm <- mutate(firm, type = fct_relevel(type, "stock", "mutual"))
    lm_firm <- lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    tidy(lm_firm, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```
    
    




# Interaction Effects

- An **interaction** between two variables means that the slope with respect to one variable changes with the value of the second variable.
