# Learning Objectives

- Chapter 1 of KNNL.
- Goals of regression analysis.
- The simple linear regression model.
- Least-squares approach to estimating parameters.
- The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates.

# Overview

- **Observational/experimental Units**: The people/places/things/animals/groups
  that we collect information about. Also known as "individuals" or "cases".
  Sometimes I just say "units".
  
- **Variable**: A property of the observational/experimental units. 
    - E.g.: height of a person, area of a country, marital status.
    
- **Value**: The specific level of a variable for an observational/experimental 
  unit.
    - E.g.: Bob is 5'11'', China has an area of 3,705,407 square miles, Jane is divorced.
    
- **Quantitative Variable**: The variable takes on numerical values where arithmetic operations ($+$/$-$/$\times$/$\div$) make sense. 
    - E.g.: height, weight, area, income.
    - Counterexample: Phone numbers, social security numbers.

- **Regression Analysis**: Study relationship between or more *quantitative* variables.

- **Response Variable**: 
    - What we think is either caused by or explained by the predictor variable. 
    - Also called "outcome variable" and "dependent variable". 
    - Usually denote this with the letter $y$.

- **Predictor Variable**: 
    - What we think causes or explains the outcome variable. 
    - Also called a "feature", "explanatory variable", "independent variable", and (when doing an experiment) a "treatment variable". 
    - Typically have more than one predictor. 
    - Usually denote these with the letters $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $\ldots$, $x_p$.

- Two quantitative variables can have either a **functional** or a **statistical** relationship.

- **Functional relationship**: There is an exact mathematical formula relating the value of one quantitative variable $x$ (the predictor) to the other $y$ (the response).
    $$
    y = f(x)
    $$
    $f()$ is some function relating the correspondence of $x$ to $y$.

    - E.g.: $x$ = the radius of a circle and $y$ = the area of a circle then
        $$
        y = \pi x^2
        $$
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(latex2exp)
    df <- tibble(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 5)) %>%
      mutate(y = pi * x ^ 2)
    
    tibble(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)) %>%
      mutate(y = pi * x ^ 2) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      geom_line() +
      geom_point(data = df) +
      theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
            axis.ticks = element_blank())
    ```
    
- **Statistical Relationship**: 
    - Is not a perfect relation. 
    - Functional + noise.
    
    - E.g. "bread and peace" data from Chapter 7 of [ROS](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) looking at the statistical relationship between economic growth and vote-share of the incumbant for president.
    
    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(readr)
    library(ggplot2)
    hibbs <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/hibbs.csv")
    qplot(x = growth, y = vote, data = hibbs) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
    ```

    - Can say higher higher growth tends to have higher vote-share. But relationship is not perfect (but still pretty good!)

    - The scattering of points about the line represents variation in vote share that is not associated with economic growth.
    
- Goals of Regression:

    1. **Description**:
        a. Gene expression ($x$) is associated with height ($y$).
        b. Biological sex ($x$) is associated with salary ($y$).
        
    2. **Prediction**:
        a. Predict sales ($y$) based on product attributes ($x$'s)
        b. Predict crop yield ($y$) based on genomic markers ($x$'s)

- When we describe relationships, this does not imply causation.
    - You need very special settings for "causal inference", which we might cover later in the course.
    - One special case where we can make causal claims is when we have a completely randomized experiment, where predictor values are randomly assigned.

- E.g. A researcher noticed that murder rates went up whenever ice cream consumption increased.

# The Simple Linear Regression Model

- The model: 
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_i X_i + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
    - $Y_i$: The response value for unit $i$. 
    
    - $X_i$: The predictor value for unit $i$.
    
    - $\beta_0$: The $y$-intercept of the regression line.
    
    - $\beta_1$: The slope of the regression line.
    
    - $\epsilon_i$: The random noise of individual $i$.
        - This is a random variable.
        - $E[\epsilon_i] = 0$ (mean zero).
        - $var(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$ (variance is the same for all $i$).
        - $cor(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j) = 0$ for all $i \neq j$ (uncorrelated errors).

- $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are typically known. We usually have a sample of $(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$.
    - E.g. $X_i$ could be the economic growth in year $i$, and $Y_i$ could be the incumbent vote-share for year $i$. 
    
- $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ are called **parameters** and are typically not observed. They must be inferred from a sample of values $(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$.

- **Regression line**: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$

- Assumptions in decreasing order of importance:
    
    1. **Linearity**: $E[Y_i|X_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i$
    
    2. **Uncorrelated errors**: $cor(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j) = 0$ for all $i \neq j$
    
    3. **Constant Variance**: $var(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$
    
- Note: Distribution of $Y_i$ is conditional on $X_i$.

    ![](./03_figs/dist.gif){width=50%}\ 

- **Exercise**: Suppose the regression model between two variables is
    $$
    Y_i = 3 + 2 x_i + \epsilon_i,~~var(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2
    $$
    
    1. What is the mean of $Y_i$ if $X_i = -1$?
    
```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
The mean is 1. 3 - 2 * -1
```

    2. What is the variance of $Y_i$ if $X_i = -1$?
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $\sigma^2$, as it is for all values of $X_i$.
    ```
    
    3. Suppose $X_i = 1$ and $Y_i = 4$. What is $\epsilon_i$?
    
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $\epsilon_i = Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i = 4 - 3 - 2 * 1 = -1$
    ```

# Review of interpretation

- $\beta_0$:
    - $Y$-intercept of the regression line.
    - If $0$ is in the range of the $X_i$'s, then can also interpret this as the value of $E[Y_i|X_i = 0]$. But cannot use this interpretation if 0 is outside of the $X_i$'s.
    
- $\beta_1$: 
    - Difference in average of $Y_i$'s when $X_i$'s differ by 1.
    - Do **not** use implicitely causal language like "change" or "increase" or "decrease".
    
- Relationships are **positive** if $\beta_1 > 0$ (larger $x$ tend to correspond to larger $y$).

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.15
    b <- 0.4
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0,2.2), c(0,a+2.2*b), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 > 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a,a+b,a+2*b), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+\\beta_1$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+2\\beta_1$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```

    

- Relationships are **negative** if $\beta_1 < 0$ (larger $x$ tend to correspond to smaller $y$).

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.95
    b <- -0.4
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0,2.2), c(0,a+.2), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 < 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a,a+b,a+2*b), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+\\beta_1$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+2\\beta_1$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```
    
- Two variables are uncorrelated if $\beta_1 = 0$ (the value of $x$ does not matter, the value of $y$ tends to stay the same).

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.15
    b <- 0
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0, 2), c(a, a), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 = 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```
    
- **Example**: In the bread and peace example, a regression line that fits the data well is

    $$
    y = 46.25 + 3.06
    $$
    
    **Correct**: Years that show 1\% more growth tend to have 3\% larger vote shares for the incumbant.
    
    **Incorrect**: Incumbant vote-share increases 3\% for each 1\% increase in growth.

- We have data $(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$, and we want to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in the equation

    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
    $$

- Idea: Try to get $Y_i$  as close to its mean. So we want each $Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i)$ to be close to 0.

- To make all of these differences on average close to zero, consider minimizing the $sum of squares$:

    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^n \left[Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i)\right]^2
    $$

- Visualization:

    ![](./ols.gif)

- We can solve for the $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that minimize this sum of squares.

- We denote the resulting estimates by $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$, and call them the **OLS estimates** (ordinary least squares estimates).

- In equations:

    \begin{align}
    \hat{\beta}_0 &= \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{X},\\
    \hat{\beta}_1 &= cor(X, Y) \frac{sd(Y)}{sd(X)},\\
    cor(X, Y) &= \frac{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})^2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}},\\
    sd(X) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})^2},\\
    sd(Y) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}.
    \end{align}
    
- Notice that the estimate of $\beta_1$ is a linear function of the correlation coefficient.

- To derive these (if you are a Statistics BS or MS, you should do this exercise once without looking at the solution):
    1. Take the derivative of the least squares objective function with respect to both $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$. 
    2. Set equal to 0 and solve for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ (2 equations and 2 unknowns).
    3. Simplify into the terms above.
    4. Use a second derivative test to verify that this is a minimum.

# Finding OLS Estimates in R

- Use `lm()` (for "linear model") to obtain coefficient estimates.

- The first argument of `lm()` is a *formula* of the form `response ~ predictor`. That squiggly line (`~`) separating the response from the predictor is called a "tilde".

- The second argument is the data frame that holds the variables.

- Using the Hibbs data

    ```{r}
    lmout <- lm(vote ~ growth, data = hibbs)
    ```

- You can print out the values and the values under `Coefficients` are the OLS estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

    ```{r}
    lmout
    ```
    
- $\hat{\beta}_0 = 46.25$

- $\hat{\beta}_1 = 3.06$

- Estimated regression line: $y = 46.25 + 3.06 x$.

- It is a pain to extract these values using base R, but the `{broom}` package has a nice function called `tidy()` that returns coefficient estimates in a data frame.

    ```{r}
    library(broom)
    est <- tidy(lmout)
    est
    est$estimate
    ```

- **Exercise**: From the `mtcars` data, find the OLS estimates of `mpg` (the response) on `wt` (the predictor). Interpret the coefficients. You can load these data into R using:

    ```{r}
    data("mtcars")
    ```

    ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    ## always plot the data first
    qplot(x = wt, y = mpg, data = mtcars) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
    
    tout <- tidy(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars))
    tout$estimate
    ```

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $\hat{\beta}_0$ = 37.285. The slope of the regression line.
    
    $\hat{\beta}_1$ = -5.344. Cars that are 1000 lbs heavier tend to have 5.3 worse miles per gallon.
    ```
