That is, this model predicts that higher income growth yields a higher vote share for the incumbent party.
    - `year`: Year of the election.
    - `growth`: Inflation-adjusted growth in average personal income.
    - `vote`: Incumbant party's vote share of the two-party vote (excludes third parties).
