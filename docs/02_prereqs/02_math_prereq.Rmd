# Learning Objectives

- Minimum mathematics required to complete this course.
- Summations/averages
- Equations for lines
- Logarithms/exponentials
- Chapter 3 of [ROS](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/)

# Motivation

- Mathematics are the building blocks of linear regression.

- Log/exponential transformations are important for the practice and interpretation of linear models.

- Calculus is important for estimating the parameters of linear models.

- Here, we will provide a brief mathematical review.

# Weighted Averages

- Consider the following data on USA, Mexico, and Canada:

    | Label  | Population $N_j$  | Average Age $\bar{y}_j$|
    |--------|-------------------|------------------------|
    | USA    | 310 Million       | 36.8                   |
    | Mexico | 112 Million       | 26.7                   |
    | Canada | 34 Million        | 40.7                   |
    
- What is the average age for these three countries?

- Proportion USA: $\frac{310}{310 + 112 + 34} = 0.68$.

- Proportion Mexico: $\frac{112}{310 + 112 + 34} = 0.25$.

- Proportion Canada: $\frac{34}{310 + 112 + 34} = 0.07$.

- So the USA contributes 68\% of the population, mexico contributes 25\% of the population, and Canada contributes 7\% of the population. To find the overall average age, we calculate:

$$
0.68 \times 36.8 + 0.25 \times 26.7 + 0.07 \times 40.7 = 34.6
$$

- We can equivalently write this as

$$
\frac{310 \times 36.8 + 112 \times 26.7 + 34 \times 40.7}{310 + 112 + 34} = \frac{310}{456}\times 36.8 + \frac{112}{456}\times 26.7 + \frac{34}{456}\times 40.7
$$

- The proportions 0.68, 0.25, and 0.07 are called the **weights**. When the weights sum to one, the overall sumation is called a **weighted average**.

- In **summation notation** (using the capital-sigma), we would write:

    \begin{align}
    \text{weighted average} &= \sum_{j=1}^n w_j y_j\\
    &= w_1y_1 + w_2y_2 + \cdots w_ny_n
    \end{align}
    
    where $w_j$ is the $j$th weight and $y_j$ is the $j$th value.

- What would be an "unweighted" average? This is where each $w_j = \frac{1}{n}$ since

    \begin{align}
    \sum_{j=1}^n w_j y_j &= \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{n} y_j\\
    &= \frac{1}{n}y_1 + \frac{1}{n}y_2 + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}y_n\\
    &= \frac{1}{n}(y_1 +y_2 + \cdots + y_n)\\
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n y_j\\
    &= \bar{y}
    \end{align}
    
- Properties of summations:
    - $\sum_{i=1}^n c a_i = c\sum_{i=1}^na_i$
    - $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i + \sum_{i=1}^nb_i = \sum_{i=1}^n(a_i + b_i)$
    
- **Exercise**: 51\% of Americans are female while 49\% of Americans are male. 79\% of teachers are female while 21\% of teachers are male. Female teachers make on average \$45,865, while male teachers make on average \$49,207. What is the average salary for all teachers?

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    We need to use the 79\%/21\% split, since we are interested in the population of teachers, not the total population. So we have
    
    0.79 * 45865 + 0.21 * 49207 = 46567
    ```

- **Exercise**: What is $\sum_{i=0}^4 i$?

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
    ```

- **Exercise**: Prove that it is not generally true that $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2$ (*hint*: provide a counterexample).

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $(1 + 2)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \neq 5 = 1^2 + 2^2$
    ```
    
## Products

- We use capital-pi notation to represent product.

    $$
    \prod_{i=1}^n a_i = a_1 \times a_2 \times \cdots \times a_n
    $$

# Lines

- All lines are of the form 
    $$
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
    $$

- $\beta_1$ is the **slope**, the amount $y$ is larger by when $x$ is 1 unit larger.

- When $\beta_1$ is *negative*, the line slopes *down*.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.95
    b <- -0.4
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0,2.2), c(0,a+.2), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 < 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a,a+b,a+2*b), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+\\beta_1$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+2\\beta_1$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```

- When $\beta_1$ is *positive*, the line slopes *up*.

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.15
    b <- 0.4
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0,2.2), c(0,a+2.2*b), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 > 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a,a+b,a+2*b), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+\\beta_1$"),TeX("$\\beta_0+2\\beta_1$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```

- When $\beta_1$ is *0*, the line is *horizontal*. In this case, $y$ is the same for every value of $x$ (in other words, $x$ does not affect $y$).

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
    a <- 0.15
    b <- 0
    par(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,.5,0), tck=-.01)
    plot(c(0, 2), c(a, a), pch=20, cex=.5, main=TeX("$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ (with $\\beta_1 = 0$)"),
      bty="l", type="n", xlab="x", ylab="y", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")
    axis(1, c(0,1,2))
    axis(2, c(a), c(TeX("$\\beta_0$")))
    abline(a, b, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
    ```
    
- **Example**: The progression of mile world records during the 20th century is well approximated by the line $y = 1007 - 0.393x$

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(readr)
    library(ggplot2)
    mile <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/mile.csv")
    qplot(x = year, y = seconds, data = mile) + 
      geom_abline(slope = -0.393, intercept = 1007, lty = 2, col = 2)
    ```
    
- The world record in 1950 was about 
    $$
    y = 1007 - 0.393 * 1950 = 240.6 \text{ seconds},
    $$
    which is actually between the two world record values of 241.4 seconds in 1946 and 239.4 seconds in 1954.
    
- Interpretation of $\beta_0$: Can we interpret 1007 seconds (16.8 minutes) as the approximate world record in ancient times? No! Our data are only from 1913 to 1999, so this is an obviously improper extrapolation. It is just the $y$-intercept, with no other interpretation.

- Interpretation of $\beta_1$: For two adjacent years, the world record is about 0.393 seconds less for the more recent year.

- Do *not* say "the world record decreases by about 0.393 seconds each year" as this creates an implicit causal connection.

- **Exercise**: Year versus maximum life expectancy (where maximum was taken over country) is well approximated by the line $y = -296 + 0.189 x$.
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
    library(gapminder)
    library(tidyverse)
    data("gapminder_unfiltered")
    gapminder_unfiltered %>%
      group_by(year) %>%
      filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
      select(country, lifeExp, year) %>%
      arrange(year) ->
      sumdat
    ggplot(sumdat, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      ylab("Maximum Life Expectancy")
    ```
    
    a. What is the expected life expectancy in 1990?
        ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
        -296 + 0.189 * 1990 = 80.11
        ```
    b. Interpret -296
        ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
        It is the $y$-intercept
        ```
    c. Interpret 0.189
        ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
        The life expectancy is about 0.189 years higher each subsequent year.
        ```

# Logarithms and Exponentials

- Often, we consider linear relationships on the log-scale. So we need to know something about logarithms and exponentials.

- Let's start with exponentials:
    $$
    \exp(x) = e^x = \underbrace{e \times \dots \times e}_{x\, \textrm{times}}
    $$.
    
    ```{r}
    ## Define e
    e <- exp(1)
    e
    
    ## show exp(3) == e * e * e
    exp(3) 
    e * e * e
    ```
    
- Recall that $e$ is [Euler's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)), which is about `r exp(1)`.

- The last equality in the above equation for `exp()` only follows if $x$ is positive integer, but exponentiation can be extended to any real number.

    ```{r}
    exp(1.414)
    ```

- $\log(x)$ is the **natural** logarithm of $x$ (not base 10). This is the inverse of exponentiation
    $$
    \log(\exp(x)) = \exp(\log(x)) = x
    $$
    
- You can verify this in R
    ```{r}
    exp(log(31))
    log(exp(31))
    ```
    
- You can also interpret $\log(x)$ as the number of times you have to divide $x$ by $e$ to obtain 1. For example, since you would have to divide $e^4$ by $e$ 4 times to get 1 ($1 = \frac{e^4}{e \times e \times e \times e}$), we have that $\log(e^4) = 4$.

- A useful property of logs/exponents is how it can convert multiplication to summation and vice versa.
    - $\exp(a + b) = \exp(a)\exp(b)$.
    - $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$.

- $\log(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ represents exponential *growth* if $\beta_1 > 0$ and exponential *decline* if $\beta_1 < 0$.
