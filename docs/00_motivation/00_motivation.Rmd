# What is simple linear regression?

1. Equation for line: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$

    ![](./figs/line_review.png)\ 

2. Have cloud of points

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=4.65, fig.height=3.6}
    qplot(x = drat, y = mpg, data = mtcars)
    ```
    
3. Fit line to cloud of points

    ```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width = 4.65, fig.height = 3.6, echo = FALSE}
    qplot(x = drat, y = mpg, data = mtcars) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
    ```
    
4. Infer slope from fitted line

    ![](./figs/infer_line.png)\ 
    
5. Inference:
    a. Test if slopes are 0
    b. Confidence intervals on slopes.
    c. Interpret sign/magnitude of slopes.
    
# What is multiple linear regression?

1. Equation for a 2-d plane:
    $$
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
    $$

    - When $x_1$ is fixed (not changing), $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$ is the equation for a line with slope $\beta_2$ and $y$-intercept $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1$.
    
    - When $x_2$ is fixed (not changing), $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$ is the equation for a line with slope $\beta_1$ and $y$-intercept $\beta_0 + \beta_2 x_2$.
    
    - So a plane can be interpreted as a line when you fix all predictors but one.

2. Have a cloud of points:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
    fig <- plot_ly() %>%
      add_markers(data = mtcars, x = ~drat, y = ~wt, z = ~mpg, size = I(20))
    fig <- fig %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'drat'),
                          yaxis = list(title = 'wt'),
                          zaxis = list(title = 'mpg')))
    fig
    ```

3. Fit plane to cloud of points:
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    lmout <- lm(mpg ~ drat + wt, data = mtcars)
    planedf <- expand.grid(drat = seq(from = min(mtcars$drat), to = max(mtcars$drat), length.out = 5),
                           wt = seq(from = min(mtcars$wt), to = max(mtcars$wt), length.out = 5))
    planedf$mpg <- predict(object = lmout, newdata = planedf)
    
    fig <- fig %>%
      add_mesh(data = planedf, x = ~drat, y = ~wt, z = ~mpg, opacity = 0.3)
    fig
    ```

4. Infer slopes from fitted plane.

5. Inference:
    a. Test if slopes are 0
    b. Confidence intervals on slopes.
    c. Interpret sign/magnitude of slopes.
    
# Steps of a Regression Analysis

- The above procedures assume that:
    1. The cloud of points roughly follows a line (or plane).
    2. All predictors (the $x$'s) are associated with the response (the $y$). We might have many predictors and we need to choose which ones to include.

- We typically need to transform the data or try out a few models. 

- Steps:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = rectangle]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']
  tab4 [label = '@@4']
  tab5 [label = '@@5']
  tab6 [label = '@@6']
  tab7 [label = '@@7']
  tab8 [label = '@@8']
  taby [label = '@@9']
  tabn [label = '@@10']
  
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3 -> tab4 -> taby -> tab6 -> tab7 -> tab8;
  tab4 -> tabn -> tab5 -> tab3;

# What can you use it for?

- Detecting trends.
    - Easy to see trends if you have two variables. Harder if you have more. Need something more sophisticated.
    - Linear regression allows us to say "folks that have bigger x tend to have bigger y".

- Control for other variables. 
    - "Folks that have the *same* z but *bigger* x tend to have bigger y."
    
- Prediction
    - Most machine learning tasks in the read world are "small data".
    - The fancy ML methods have many parameters that require lots of data to estimate.
    - Linear regression is often the best you can do in small data tasks.

# Generality

- Many statistical procedures are special cases of (or approximations to) linear regression.

- Understanding linear regression really well will give you a deeper understanding of statistics in general.

- Procedures that are special cases of linear regression, or can be well approximated by linear regression:
    - One/two sample $t$-test.
    - ANOVA
    - Correlation tests
    - Rank tests
    - Chi-square tests
    - Many others
