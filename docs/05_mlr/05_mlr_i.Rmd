# Learning Objectives

- Multiple linear regression model definition and interpretation.
- Indicator variables, transformed variables, interaction effects,
- Inference
- Diagnostics and remedial measures.
- Chapter 6 of KNNL

# Motivation

- Most regression problems have more than one predictor.

- Multiple linear regression explores the relationship between **one response variable** and **multiple predictor variables**.

    - (if you have multiple response variables, this is called "multivariate" regression, and is a separate topic)

- Examples: 
    - Predicting volume of tractor sales in a territory ($Y$) given number of farms ($X_1$) and crop production ($X_2$).
    - Predicting a political party's vote share in a congressional district ($Y$) given that party's vote share in the previous election ($X_1$) and the incumbancy's status of the political party ($X_2$).

- Why include more predictors?
    - You can often get a more accurate prediction of $Y$ if you include more $X$'s.
    - You can control for other variables when assessing the relationship between a response and a predictor of interest.
    
- Controlling is necessary because the strength/sign of a relationship might change once you control for a variable.

- Consider the earnings data described [here](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data.html#Earnings_Data) and available for download [here](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/earnings.csv).


# The model

- The multiple linear regression (MLR) model is of the form

    \begin{align}
    Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_pX_{i,p-1} + \epsilon_i\\
    E[\epsilon_i] &= 0\\
    var(\epsilon_i) &= \sigma^2\\
    cov(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j) &= 0 \text{ for all } i \neq j
    \end{align}
    
- Using summation notation, we can write the top equation by
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\beta_j X_{ji}
    $$
