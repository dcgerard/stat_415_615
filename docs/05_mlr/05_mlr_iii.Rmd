# Quadratic Terms

- Consider the Muscle Mass data which explores the association between age and muscle mass. You can read about it [here](https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data.html#Muscle_Mass).

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(broom)
    muscle <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/muscle.csv")
    glimpse(muscle)
    ```

- These data look like a quadratic fit could help
    ```{r}
    qplot(x = age, y = mass, data = muscle) +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    
    lm_musc <- lm(mass ~ age, data = muscle)
    a_musc <- augment(lm_musc)
    qplot(x = .fitted, y = .resid, data = a_musc) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 2)
    ```
    
- A quadratice regression model with one predictor variable is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_{2}X_{i}^2 + \epsilon_i
    $$
    with the usual assumptions on the errors.

- We fit this in R by first creating a new variable, say `age2`, with contains `age` squared.
    ```{r}
    muscle <- mutate(muscle, age2 = age^2)
    glimpse(muscle)
    ```

- We then fit a multiple linear regression model using `age` and `age2` as predictors.

    ```{r}
    lm_musc2 <- lm(mass ~ age + age2, data = muscle)
    tidy(lm_musc2)
    ```

- The estimated regression surface is
    $$
    \hat{Y} = 207.360 - 2.964X + 0.015X^2
    $$
    
- The $p$-value corresponding to `age2` is a test for the quadratic term (linear regression as the null versus quadratic regression as the alternative). The $p$-value in this case (0.08) says that we only have week evidence of a quadratic relationship.

- **Exercise**: Write out the null and alternative models associated with the $p$-value of 0.08109.

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    - $H_0: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$
    - $H_A: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    ```


- **Exercise**: What are the null and alternative models associated with the $p$-value of 0.004535?

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    - $H_0: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    - $H_A: Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_2X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$
    ```

- It's possible to fit higher order polynomials. E.g. a cubic polynomial
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \beta_{2}X_{i}^2 + \beta_3 X_{i}^3 + \epsilon_i
    $$
    We would do this via
    
    ```{r}
    muscle <- mutate(muscle, age3 = age^3)
    lm_m3 <- lm(mass ~ age + age2 + age3, data = muscle)
    tidy(lm_m3)
    ```
    However, it is rarely a good idea to fit terms higher than quadratic. This is because
    
    1. They tend to be sensative to overfitting and
    2. They are hard to interpret.
    
    So at that point, you should just fit a cubic spline to these data, since it will be equally uninterpretable.
    
- If you include a quadratic term you should **always** include the linear term as well.

- That is, you should **never** fit the model
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{2} X_i^2 + \epsilon_i
    $$
    even if the $p$-value is very high for the $\beta_1$ coefficient..
    
- Why? This follows the same logic as always including the intercept term in the model. Lower order terms are thought to provide more basic information on the relationship, so you should include them.

- More generally, if you do end up using a cubic term, you should always include both linear and quadratic terms in the model, etc...


- When there are multiple predictors in the model, it is usual to denote quadratic coefficients with repeat indices. E.g.
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{2}X_{i2} + \beta_{22}X_{i2}^2 + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- **Exericse**: Write out a model that contains two predictors, $X_{i1}$ and $X_{i2}$, where only $X_{i2}$ is quadratic (and so the model is linear in $X_{i1}$). Use the repeated indexing that we just introduced.

    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{2}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    ```
    
## Practical considerations for using quadratic terms

From the *Statisitcal Sleuth*: 
- Quadratic terms should not routinely be included. 

- Use in four situations: 
    1. When the analyst has good reason to suspect that the response is nonlinear in some explanatory variable (through knowledge of the process or by graphical examination).
    2. When the question of interest calls for finding the values that maximize or minimize the mean response.
    3. When careful modeling of the regression is called for by the questions of interest (and presumably this is only the case if there are just a few explanatory variables).
    4. When inclusion is used to produce a rich model for assessing the fit of an inferential model.

# Categorical Variables

## Two classes

- An innovation in the insurance industry was introduced, and a researcher wanted to study what factors affect how quickly different insurance firms adopted this new innovation. Variables include
    - `months`: How long, in months, it took the firm to adopt the new innovation.
    - `size`: The amount of total assets of the insurance firm, in millions of dollars.
    - `type`: The type of firm. Either a mutual company (`"mutual"`) or a stock company (`"stock"`).
    
    You can load these data into R via:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    firm <- read_csv("https://dcgerard.github.io/stat_415_615/data/firm.csv")
    glimpse(firm)
    ```

- Recall that we deal with categorical variables by creating indicators
    $$
    X_{i2} =
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if stock company}\\
    0 & \text{ otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

- If a categorical variable has $c$ classes, then we need to use $c-1$ indicator variables to represent this categorical variable. 

- Here, $c = 2$ (for `"stock"` and `"mutual"`), so we only need $c-1=1$ indicator variable.

- Let $Y_i$ be the number of months elapsed for company $i$, and $X_{i1}$ be the size of the firm in millions of dollars. Then we will fit the following model.

    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- The interpretation of $\beta_1$ is as usual. Firms that are the same type, but are 10 million dollars larger, tended to take $10 \times \beta_1$ months less to innovate.
    
- To interpret $\beta_2$, consider that the model for mutual companies is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    while the model for stock companies is
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the same in both instances.
    
- This means that $\beta_2$ is the expected difference in months between mutual and stock companies that are about the same size.

- Let's visualize this model
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    
    firm %>%
      rename(Type = type) %>%
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = size, y = months, color = Type)) +
      geom_point() +
      theme_classic() +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.102, intercept = 33.874, color = "#005AB5", lwd = 1.5) +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.102, intercept = 41.93, color = "#DC3220", lwd = 1.5) +
      xlab("Size of Firm (millions of dollars)") +
      ylab("Number of Months Elapsed") +
      scale_color_manual(values = c("#005AB5", "#DC3220")) ->
      pl
      ## ggsave(filename = "./figs/cat_interp.pdf", plot = pl, height = 4, width = 5.5)
    ```
    
    ```{r,echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/cat_interp.png")
    ```

- In R, you fit this model by first converting the categorical variable into a **factor** with `parse_factor()` from the `{readr}` package. You specify the order of the levels by the `levels` argument, where the first level is the **reference level** (the one that does not have an indicator for it).
    ```{r}
    firm <- mutate(firm, type = parse_factor(type, levels = c("mutual", "stock")))
    ```
    Then you can use the new factor variable in `lm()`. It will automatically create $c-1$ indicator variables to fit.
    ```{r}
    lm_firm <- lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    tidy(lm_firm, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```
    We conclude that stock companies tended to take 8 months longer than mutual companies to adopt the new innovation (95\% CI of 5 to 11 months longer), adjusting for company size. Companies of the same type that had \$10 million more assets tended to take 1 fewer month to adopt the new innovation (95\% CI of 0.8 to 1.2 fewer months).
    
- If you wanted to change which level is the reference level of a factor variable, you could use `fct_relevel()` from the `{forcats}` package (a part of the tidyverse).
    ```{r}
    firm <- mutate(firm, type = fct_relevel(type, "stock", "mutual"))
    lm_firm <- lm(months ~ size + type, data = firm)
    tidy(lm_firm, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```


- Why not fit two separate regressions (one for each firm)?
    1. Enforces interpretability of $\beta_2$ parameter since otherwise $\beta_1$ would differ between firms.
    2. Use all of the data to estimate $\beta_1$.
    3. Use all of the data to estimate $\sigma^2$.
    
## More than two classes

- If a categorical variable has $c$ classes, then you use $c-1$ indicator variables to represent this variable.


- The `mpg` dataset's `drv` variable has classes `"f"`, `"4"`, and `"r"`.
    ```{r}
    data("mpg")
    unique(mpg$drv)
    ```

- We can represent this categorical variable with two indicator variables:

    \begin{align}
    X_{i1} &= 
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if front-wheel drive}\\
    0 & \text{ otherwise}
    \end{cases}\\
    X_{i2} &= 
    \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{ if 4-wheel drive}\\
    0 & \text{ otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \end{align}
    
- Suppose we want to explore the association between log-`cty` with `displ` and `drv`. Let $Y$ be the city miles per gallon, $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the indicator variables for front- and 4-wheel drive cars, and let $X_3$ be the car's engine displacement (in liters). Then our model is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \beta_3X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$

- The model for rear-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_3X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    The model for front-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_3X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    The model for 4-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$

- Interpretation:
    - $\beta_1$ is the average difference in city mpg between rear-wheel and front drive cars of about the same engine size.
    
    - $\beta_2$ is the average difference in city mpg between rear-wheel and 4-wheel drive cars of about the same engine size.
    
    - $\beta_2 - \beta_1$ is the average difference in city mpg between 4-wheel and front wheel drive cars of about the same engine size.
    
    - $\beta_3$ is the average difference in city mpg between cars that are of the same type, but have 1 liter different engine displacement.

- We can visualize this model below:

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = log(cty), color = drv)) +
      xlim(range(mpg$displ)) +
      ylim(range(log(mpg$cty))) +
      xlab("Engine Displacement (liters)") +
      ylab("log(City mpg)") +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.14256, intercept = 3.37044+0.3, color = "#005AB5", lwd = 1.5) +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.14256, intercept = 3.37044 - 0.1, color = "#DC3220", lwd = 1.5) +
      geom_abline(slope = -0.14256, intercept = 3.37044 - 0.3, color = "#FFC107", lwd = 1.5) +
      theme_classic() +
      theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
            axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) ->
      pl
    # ggsave(filename = "./figs/cat_interp_3.pdf", plot = pl, height = 4, width = 5.5)
    ```

    ```{r,echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(path = "./figs/cat_interp3.png")
    ```

- We fit this model in R by first selecting the order of the levels of `drv` to include rear-wheel drive cars as the reference class. We do this using `parse_factor()` from the `{forcats}` package:
    ```{r}
    mpg <- mutate(mpg, 
                  l_cty = log(cty),
                  drv = parse_factor(drv, levels = c("r", "f", "4")))
    ```
    Then we run `lm()`.
    ```{r}
    lm_mpg <- lm(l_cty ~ drv + displ, data = mpg)
    tidy(lm_mpg, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```

- The estimated regression surface is
    $$
    \log(\text{city mpg}) = 3.37 - 0.026\times \text{front} - 0.158 \times \text{4-wheel} - 0.142 \times \text{displacement}
    $$

- We obtained confidence intervals for each of these coefficients, but how do we obtain a confidence interval for $\beta_2 - \beta_1$ (the difference in average mpg between front- and 4-wheel drive cars of the same size)? There are some third-party packages that do this. But an easy way is to just hange which class is the reference

    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    mpg <- mutate(mpg, drv = fct_relevel(drv, "f", "r", "4"))
    lm_mpg_2 <- lm(l_cty ~ drv + displ, data = mpg)
    tidy(lm_mpg_2, conf.int = TRUE)
    ```
    So this confidence interval is -0.175 to -0.089.


# Interaction Effects

- An **interaction** between two variables means that the slope with respect to one variable changes with the value of the second variable.

- We represent this is by multiplying the two variables together.
    $$
    Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_{2}X_{i2} + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$

- The slope with respect to $X_1$ when $X_2$ is fixed is $\beta_1 + \beta_{12}X_2$

- The slope with respect to $X_2$ when $X_1$ is fixed is $\beta_2 + \beta_{12}X_1$

- NOTE: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ **no longer** represent the expected difference in $Y$ given a unit difference of $X_1$ or $X_2$, respectively.
    
    - $\beta_1$ is the expected difference in $Y$ given a unit difference in $X_1$ if $X_2 = 0$. This interpretation only makes sense if 0 is in the range of $X_2$.
    
    - $\beta_2$ is the expected difference in $Y$ given a unit difference in $X_2$ if $X_1 = 0$. This interpretation only makes sense if 0 is in the range of $X_1$.
    
    - Generally, it is not useful to provide these interpretations of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$.

- The association between $X_1$ and $Y$ depends on the level of $X_2$. Likewise, the association between $X_2$ and $Y$ depends on the level of $X_1$.

- When $\beta_{12}$ is positive, this is called an interaction of the **reinforcement** or **synergistic** type. The slope is more positive for more positive levels of $X_1$ or $X_2$.

- When $\beta_{12}$ is negative, this is called an interaction of the **interference** or **antagonistic** type. The slope is less positive for more positive levels of $X_1$ or $X_2$.

- Synergistic:

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    library(ggthemes)
    library(latex2exp)
    beta0 <- 0
    beta1 <- 2
    beta2 <- 1.5
    beta12 <- 2
    x1 <- seq(0, 2, length.out = 2)
    x2 <- seq(0, 2, length.out = 3)
    expand.grid(x1 = x1, x2 = x2) %>%
      mutate(y = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2 + beta12 * x1 * x2,
             x2 = as_factor(x2)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y, color = x2)) +
      geom_line() +
      scale_color_colorblind(name = TeX("$X_{2}$")) +
      ggtitle(TeX("$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \\epsilon_i$")) +
      xlab(TeX("$X_1$")) +
      ylab(TeX("$Y$"))
    ```
    
- Antagonistic:

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
    library(ggthemes)
    library(latex2exp)
    beta0 <- 0
    beta1 <- 2
    beta2 <- 1.5
    beta12 <- -0.5
    x1 <- seq(0, 2, length.out = 2)
    x2 <- seq(0, 2, length.out = 3)
    expand.grid(x1 = x1, x2 = x2) %>%
      mutate(y = beta0 + beta1 * x1 + beta2 * x2 + beta12 * x1 * x2,
             x2 = as_factor(x2)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y, color = x2)) +
      geom_line() +
      scale_color_colorblind(name = TeX("$X_{2}$")) +
      ggtitle(TeX("$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_{i1} + \\beta_2X_{i2} + \\beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \\epsilon_i$")) +
      xlab(TeX("$X_1$")) +
      ylab(TeX("$Y$"))
    ```

- If you include an interaction term, make sure that you include all lower-order terms. That is, **Never** fit a model like
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2}
    $$
    - Why? The above model says that the effect of $X_1$ depends on the level of $X_2$, but there is no effect of $X_1$. This is a logical inconsistancy.

- For the `mtcars` dataset, suppose we are fitting a model for mpg ($Y$) on the rear-axel ration ($X_1$) and weight ($X_2$). The model with interactions is:
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$

- We don't need to make transformations ahead of time. In `lm()`, we just multiply the variables together. It will automatically include all lower-order terms.
    ```{r}
    lm_mt <- lm(mpg ~ drat * wt, data = mtcars)
    tidy(lm_mt)
    ```

- We actually have some evidence here of needing an interaction. 

- We would still include `wt` in the model even though it has a large $p$-value.

- You can provide an interpretation to a client when there are interactions via  **conditional effects plots** that plot the relationship between $Y$ and $X_i$ at different levels of the other $X$'s.

    ```{r}
    ## drat versus mpg at different levels of wt
    wt_seq <- quantile(mtcars$mpg, c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975))
    dr_seq <- seq(min(mtcars$drat), max(mtcars$drat), length.out = 100)
    newdf <- expand.grid(wt = wt_seq, drat = dr_seq)
    newdf$mpg <- predict(object = lm_mt, newdata = newdf)
    newdf <- mutate(newdf, wt = as_factor(round(wt, digits = 2)))
    qplot(x = drat, y = mpg, color = wt, data = newdf, geom = "line")
    
    ## wt versus mpg at different levels of drat
    wt_seq <- seq(min(mtcars$wt), max(mtcars$wt), length.out = 100)
    dr_seq <- quantile(mtcars$drat, c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975))
    newdf <- expand.grid(wt = wt_seq, drat = dr_seq)
    newdf$mpg <- predict(object = lm_mt, newdata = newdf)
    newdf <- mutate(newdf, drat = as_factor(round(drat, digits = 2)))
    qplot(x = wt, y = mpg, color = drat, data = newdf, geom = "line")
    ```


## Interactions and categorical variables.
    
- An interaction between a categorical and quantitative variable means that each level of the categorical variable has its own line (different intercepts and slopes).

- Let's study again the association between `cty` ($Y$) with `displ` ($X_3$) and `drv` from the `mpg` dataset.

    ```{r}
    data("mpg")
    mpg_sub <- select(mpg, drv, displ, cty)
    glimpse(mpg_sub)
    ```

- We fit the following model (recall that $X_1$ is the indicator for front-wheel drive and $X_2$ is the indicator for 4-wheel drive cars).
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \beta_3X_{i3} + \beta_{13}X_{i1}X_{i3} + \beta_{23}X_{i2}X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- If you include an interaction between one indicator for a categorical and a quantitative, then you should include interactions for all of the indicators with that quantitative. R will do this automatically as long as you use factors.

- To interpret this model, you should think about what the response surface is for each class in the categorical variable.

    - The model for rear-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_3X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    - The model for front-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + (\beta_3 + \beta_{13})X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    - The model for 4-wheel drive cars is
    $$
    \log(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + (\beta_3 + \beta_{23})X_{i3} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    
- $\beta_{13}$ is the expected difference in the slope between rear-wheel and front-wheel drive cars.

- $\beta_{23}$ is the expected difference in the slope between rear-wheel and 4-wheel drive cars.

- But it is better to just interpret interactions here by making conditional effects plots. This is the default output of `geom_smooth()` when you color code by a categorical variable:

    ```{r}
    qplot(x = displ, y = cty, color = drv, data = mpg) +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
      scale_y_log10()
    ```


- To fit this in R, just make sure you have the reference level as you like via `parse_factor()` or `fct_relevel()`. Then use `lm()` the same way with interactions as before (using multiplication).
    ```{r}
    mpg_sub <- mutate(mpg_sub, 
                      drv = parse_factor(drv, levels = c("r", "f", "4")),
                      l_cty = log(cty))
    lm_mpg_int <- lm(l_cty ~ drv * displ, data = mpg_sub)
    tidy(lm_mpg_int)
    ```

- **Exercise**: What is the estimated regression surface for rear-wheel drive cars? Front-wheel drive cars? 4-wheel drive cars?
```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
- Rear-wheel:
    $$
    \log(\hat{Y}) = 3 - 0.07X_3
    $$
    
- front-wheel:
    $$
    \log(\hat{Y}) = 3 + 0.42 + (-0.07 - 0.1) X_3 = 3.42 - 0.17 X_3
    $$
    
- 4-wheel:
    $$
    \log(\hat{Y}) = 3 + 0.21 + (-0.07 - 0.07) X_3 = 3.21 - 0.14X_3
    $$
```

- We obtain the same regression surface as if we fit three different models to the three different classes.

    ```{r}
    mpg_sub_r <- filter(mpg_sub, drv == "r")
    tidy(lm(l_cty ~ displ, data = mpg_sub_r))
    ```

- The benefit of fitting a single model is then
    1. We can directly test for the "different lines" model using $F$-tests
    2. We use all of the data to estimate the residual variance.
    
- The $p$-values for the interaction terms in the above output are **not** useful. This is because they only test for the association for an interaction between `displ` and a single indicator variable. But we want to test whether there is an interaction between `displ` and `drv`.
    
- Let's test for an interaction between `displ` and `drv`. We do so by fitting models both with and with out interactions. We then use `anova()` to run an $F$-test.

    ```{r}
    lm_mpg_no_int <- lm(l_cty ~ drv + displ, data = mpg_sub)
    lm_mpg_int <- lm(l_cty ~ drv * displ, data = mpg_sub)
    anova(lm_mpg_no_int, lm_mpg_int)
    ```
    So we have moderate evidence of an interaction effect ($p = 0.026$).


## Usage guidelines

From the *Statistical Sleuth*:

- Interaction terms should not be routinely included in regression models. 

- Use in three scenarios:
    1. When a question of interest pertains to interaction.
    2. When good reason exists to suspect interactions (e.g. *a priori* knowledge or residual plots strongly suggest such).
    3. When interactions are proposed as a more general model for the purpose of examining the goodness of fit of a model without interaction.

# Example

- If you only have a few predictors, it is often a good idea to fit a saturated second-order model and compare the fully linear model to it as a type of lack-of-fit test.
    - *Saturated second-order model*: A model with all possible quadratic and interaction terms, along with lower-order terms.

- For example, with two predictors:
    \begin{align}
    H_0: Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \epsilon_i\\
    H_A: Y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{22}X_{i2}^2  + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    \end{align}
    
- Rejecting the null here indicates that we have evidence of a lack-of-fit and should include some quadratic or interaction terms.

- Let's look at a case example studying the effects of temperature ($X_1$) in celsius and charge rate ($X_2$) in amperes on life expectancy of a batter ($Y$) in the number of cycles before death. Data can be read into R via
    ```{r}
    power <- tibble::tribble(
      ~cycles, ~charge, ~temp,
          150,     0.6,    10,
           86,       1,    10,
           49,     1.4,    10,
          288,     0.6,    20,
          157,       1,    20,
          131,       1,    20,
          184,       1,    20,
          109,     1.4,    20,
          279,     0.6,    30,
          235,       1,    30,
          224,     1.4,    30
      )
    ```

    We fit the model
    $$
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{i1} + \beta_2X_{i2} + \beta_{11}X_{i1}^2 + \beta_{22}X_{i2}^2  + \beta_{12}X_{i1}X_{i2} + \epsilon_i
    $$
    and run the hypothesis tests for
    $$
    H_0: \beta_{11} = \beta_{22} = \beta_{12} = 0\\
    H_A: \text{ at least one of } \beta_{11}, \beta_{22}, \beta_{12} \text{ nonzero}
    $$

- We can run this test because the reduced model is a subset of the full model.

- Let's fit the full and reduced models    
    ```{r}
    power <- mutate(power, charge2 = charge ^ 2, temp2 = temp ^ 2)
    lm_full <- lm(cycles ~ charge * temp + charge2 + temp2, data = power)
    lm_reduced <- lm(cycles ~ charge + temp, data = power)
    ```

- We then run `anova()` to run the corresponding $F$-test    
    ```{r}
    anova(lm_reduced, lm_full)
    ```

- We do not have evidence of a lack-of-fit ($p=0.55$)

- **Exercise**: What is $SSE(F)$? $SSE(R)$? $dr_F$? $df_R$?
    ```{block, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    - $SSE(F)$: 5240
    - $SSE(R)$: 7700
    - $dr_F$: 5
    - $df_R$: 8
    ```

- If we would have failed to reject, the best course of action for interpretation would be to come up with conditional effects plots.

    ```{r}
    ## Conditional effects plot for charge
    charge_seq <- unique(power$charge)
    temp_seq <- seq(min(power$temp), max(power$temp), length.out = 200)
    expand.grid(charge = charge_seq, temp = temp_seq) %>%
      mutate(charge2 = charge^2,
             temp2 = temp^2) ->
      newdf
    newdf$cycles <- predict(object = lm_full, newdata = newdf)
    newdf <- mutate(newdf, charge = as_factor(charge))
    qplot(x = temp, y = cycles, color = charge, data = newdf, geom = "line")
    
    ## Conditional effects plot for temperature
    temp_seq <- unique(power$temp)
    charge_seq <- seq(min(power$charge), max(power$charge), length.out = 200)
    expand.grid(charge = charge_seq, temp = temp_seq) %>%
      mutate(charge2 = charge^2,
             temp2 = temp^2) ->
      newdf
    newdf$cycles <- predict(object = lm_full, newdata = newdf)
    newdf <- mutate(newdf, temp = as_factor(temp))
    qplot(x = charge, y = cycles, color = temp, data = newdf, geom = "line")
    ```

    - `scrap`: Amount of scrap (coded).
    - `speed`: Line production speed (coded).
    - `line`: Production line. Either `"line1"` or `"line2"`.
